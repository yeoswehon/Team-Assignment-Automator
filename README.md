# Team Assignment Automator (SC1003-Mini-Project)
This repository contains the scripts and notebooks used to automatically split each 50-student tutorial group into balanced, diverse teams of configurable size (4â€“10 members). We ensure that within every team:
- No more than two students share the same school affiliation
- No gender majority (>50%)
- CGPA averages remain roughly equal by first binning into quartiles
